# kalsa-bot-rust

My feeble attempt at rewriting a working telegram bot in rust

## This telegram bot checks if Arena Center Hakaniemi (aka Hakis) has an available shift at a specific time and posts the data as response

How to use bot:

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Henqi/kalsa-bot-rust.git
```

2. Make sure you are in the kalsa-bot-rust directory 

```bash
cd kalsa-bot-rust
```

3. Install rust with rustup (https://rustup.rs/)
4. Setup .env file with secret telegram bot APIKEY
5. Build project with cargo 

```bash
cargo build
```

6. Run project with cargo

```bash
cargo run
```

6. Hope it works ðŸ¤ž
